        <p>
            <h3 class="p">My name is Jehad but most people call me Jed. I’m 21 and I have been studying graphic design for one year. So far, I have been enjoying this journey as a designer. Before I decide to become a graphic designer, I never really knew what I wanted to become I just knew I liked being techy and being artistic. So before I decided to go for graphic design I ended up trying to go for computer engineering after a semester of that I knew I wouldn’t be able to do that so I spent some time looking for a mixture of art and tech and that’s when I found out about graphic design and ever since then I haven’t regretted switching.
                As I continue to learn more about being a designer the more I have grown to be able to accomplish things I wouldn’t have before. I one day would like to either be working for a big company or to be able to run my own studio business with people working with me.
